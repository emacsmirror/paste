A pastebin with Elnode.

This is very simple right now. I'm not sure where I'm going with it
except it's a useful demonstration of what you can do with very little
code.

The pastes are stored in: {{{/tmp/pasteel/}}}

Other things that would be good:

* use emacs-db to store details so a user's paste's can be retrieved
* allow comments on pastes
* allow tweets on pastes
* allow pastes to be edited with a live editing like feature (so they magically update)
